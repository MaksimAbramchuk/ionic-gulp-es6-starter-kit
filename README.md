Ionic application boilerplate for Gulp and ES6

![Ionic and Angular](http://moduscreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ionic-angular-opti.png)

## Features
* ES6 instead of ES5
* SCSS instead of CSS
* Automatic compilation
* Livereload
* Development build with source maps
* Automatic bower components injection
* Automatic scripts and stylesheets injection

## Usage

## Installation process

For the first you need to install Node packages by running:

```sh
npm install
```

after that install bower components by running

```sh
bower install
```

Both `bower` and `npm` must be installed globally at your local machine.

You are ready to start the server.

### Running the App during Development
This command automatically compiles ES6 to ES5, scss, injects bower components, generates source maps, starts livereload server and opens your app in the browser.

```sh
gulp serve
```
### Mobile app
When your app is interesting enough to be tested on mobile device, create a build.

Don't forget to compile from sources:
```sh
gulp
```

And then we can create the build for iOS:

```sh
ionic build ios
```

and even test it, if you use OS X:

```sh
ionic emulate ios
``` 

More info about builds, including Android, can be found in Ionic tutorial.
 
One more interesting feature Ionic has: Ionic View. It's amazing thing and I recommend you to try it - pretty simple to use and saves tones of time for debug and testing on real devices. To start, just run:

```sh
ionic upload
```
